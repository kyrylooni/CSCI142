      "main" : "Slide 3: Historical Background\n\n- The conflict in Ukraine has deep historical roots dating back to the 18th century.\n- The region has long been a geopolitical battleground, often changing hands between different empires and powers.\n- In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Ukraine experienced a surge of nationalist sentiment, leading to the establishment of the Ukrainian People's Republic in 1917.\n- However, the republic's independence was short-lived, as it was invaded and eventually absorbed into the Soviet Union in 1922.\n- Under Soviet rule, Ukraine experienced severe repression, including the devastating Holodomor famine in the 1930s, which led to millions of deaths.\n- The fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 brought newfound independence to Ukraine, but also created a power vacuum and led to economic and political instability.\n- Ukraine's strategic location and resources, such as its fertile farmland and access to the Black Sea, have made it a coveted territory for various powers throughout history.\n- The tension between Ukraine's desire for independence and the interests of neighboring countries has set the stage for the current conflict."
